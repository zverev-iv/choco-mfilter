    <description>MFilter is a filter plugin for the popular 7-Zip archiver designed to deliver higher compression ratios to certain multimedia file types by means of automatic pre-processing. The filter itself does not provide compression, and requires co-use of a compressing codec.

Specifically, here is what MFilter does over the files being compressed:

- The filter recompresses jpeg files using Brunsli or Lepton methods. This also applies to embedded thumbnails and jpeg files attached to or embedded into other files, like pdf.
- The filter performs delta encoding of the following raster graphic file types:
  - uncompressed bmp
  - pnm (ppm, pgm, pam)
  - uncompressed tiff
  - uncompressed dng
  - uncompressed raw (3fr, arw, nef and others)
  - uncompressed tga
-The filter uses the WavPack method to compress wav-files with uncompressed PCM audio. The following file types are automatically identified and compressed:
  - wav (including bwf/rf64 и Multiple Data Chunks (Legasy Audition Format) formats)
  - caf (Core Audio Format)
  - w64 (Sony Wave64)
  - dff (Philips DSDIFF)
  - dsf (Sony DSD stream)
  - aif, afc (Аudio Interchange File Format, including AIFF-C format)
  - sf2 (SoundFont)
- The filter decodes data in BASE64 format.
- The filter applies BCJ, ARM, ARMT, IA64, SPARC and PPC filters to the corresponding executables.
